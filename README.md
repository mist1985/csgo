# [Project Name]: Playwright / Typescript automation test - Assessment for the position for QA engineer (Fully remote; 2 yrs xp @ $60k)

Welcome to my repository showcasing my expertise in automated testing with Playwright.


## Introduction

This project demonstrates my skills and knowledge in automated testing, which is part of the assessment for the position as described in the Google Form document. It reflects my capability in scripting, testing, and ensuring software quality.

In this automation suite, I focused on verifying the visibility of various elements and the functionality of the bet amount feature.
The betting feature testing included entering a bet, incrementing it, and clearing it. 
Additionally, the tests validate the redirection to the sign-in process to the Steam login page.

While the original scope of the assignment was confined only to the Roulette page, I took the liberty to expanded the tests to include the Withdraw page. 
This decision was made to demonstrate the application of the Page Object Model. The test on the Withdraw page is realtively simple and it primarily tests the visibility of different elements.

Regarding the choice of selectors, I employed a range of selector types. 
I would like to point out that my personal preference leans towards using user-facing attribute selectors rather than XPaths, as I find them more robust and maintainable in the long term.
This approach aligns with best practices for ensuring more stable and reliable test scripts.
