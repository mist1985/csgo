## Testing Approach for Roulette at [csgoempire.com/roulette](https://csgoempire.com/roulette)

### Exploratory Testing
#### UI and Load Testing
- Verify that all UI elements such as buttons, text fields, and all of the graphics load correctly.
- Make sure that there are no broken links or images. I personally use tools like Screaming Frog for link validation.
- Check the browser's inspect console tools to check for any errors.
- Make sure that " Stop! Do not send anyone your cookies or paste any code in here. Any "hacks" or "exploits" are a SCAM! They WILL steal all of your coins. " it is cleary shown.

### Cross-Browser Testing
#### UI Consistency
- Make sure that there is consistency of UI elements across various browsers and operating systems.
