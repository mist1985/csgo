How would you approach the testing of roulette? Describe the tests that you would do and the things you'd pay attention to.


1. Exploratory testing

The first thing would be to go through an exploratory testing of the site, to make sure that everything loads as it should, that all the UI elements like buttons, text fields, and graphics are displayed.
There are no broken links, broken images, or misplaced elements.
I use a tool called Screaming Frog, which checks all of the links if some links are 404, or 500s.
- Open the Inspect console tools for any errors. Make sure that the warning message
"Stop! Do not send anyone your cookies or paste any code in here. Any "hacks" or "exploits" are a SCAM! They WILL steal all of your coins." is clearly visible.

2. Cross-browser testing

The second test would be to check the consistency of the UI elements across multiple browsers, operating systems and mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets).
A tool that I would use for this would be BrowserStack. This would also test the site's responsive design.

3. Locale (Language) testing
Check the UI interface in different supported languages. Whether all the data displayed is correct, and whether all supported languages are displaying correctly.
https://csgoempire.com/faq for example the paragraph sections do not support languages.  

4. Functionality of the web elements. All these tests will be covered as mentioned earlier in multiple browsers/OS/devices.
